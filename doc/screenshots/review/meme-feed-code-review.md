# Code Review: MemeFeedPage Performance Issues

The current implementation of the `MemeFeedPage` component has significant performance issues related to data fetching. The main problem is the improper implementation of pagination, where the code attempts to retrieve all memes and all comments at once, rather than loading data incrementally as needed. This approach will lead to:

1. Excessive API calls
2. Poor user experience due to long initial load times
3. Potential memory issues with large datasets
4. Unnecessary network traffic

## Identified Issues

### 1. Fetching All Meme Pages at Once

The current implementation fetches all memes across all pages in a single query function:

```javascript
const { isLoading, data: memes } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["memes"],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const memes: GetMemesResponse["results"] = [];
    const firstPage = await getMemes(token, 1);
    memes.push(...firstPage.results);
    const remainingPages =
      Math.ceil(firstPage.total / firstPage.pageSize) - 1;
    for (let i = 0; i < remainingPages; i++) {
      const page = await getMemes(token, i + 2);
      memes.push(...page.results);
    }
    // ... more code ...
  }
});
```

This code will attempt to fetch all available meme pages sequentially, even if there are hundreds or thousands of pages. This is highly inefficient and creates a poor user experience as users need to wait for all data to load before seeing anything.

### 2. Fetching All Comments for Each Meme

For each meme, the code fetches all comments across all pages:

```javascript
const comments: GetMemeCommentsResponse["results"] = [];
const firstPage = await getMemeComments(token, meme.id, 1);
comments.push(...firstPage.results);
const remainingCommentPages =
  Math.ceil(firstPage.total / firstPage.pageSize) - 1;
for (let i = 0; i < remainingCommentPages; i++) {
  const page = await getMemeComments(token, meme.id, i + 2);
  comments.push(...page.results);
}
```

This multiplies the performance issue, as for each meme, all available comment pages are being fetched, regardless of whether users will actually view these comments.

### 3. Sequential API Calls for User Data

The code makes individual API calls to fetch user data for both meme authors and comment authors:

```javascript
for (let meme of memes) {
  const author = await getUserById(token, meme.authorId);
  // ... fetch comments ...
  
  const commentsWithAuthor = [];
  for (let comment of comments) {
    const author = await getUserById(token, comment.authorId);
    commentsWithAuthor.push({ ...comment, author });
  }
  // ...
}
```

This approach creates a cascade of sequential API calls, significantly increasing the load time.

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Implement Client-Side Pagination

Instead of fetching all pages at once, implement proper client-side pagination:

```javascript
const { isLoading, data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["memes", currentPage],
  queryFn: () => getMemes(token, currentPage),
});
```
loading additional pages on scroll or button click.

For example, you can fetch one page at a time using `useInfiniteQuery` from `@tanstack/react-query`

```javascript
const {
  data,
  fetchNextPage,
  hasNextPage,
  isFetchingNextPage,
} = useInfiniteQuery({
  queryKey: ["memes"],
  queryFn: async ({ pageParam = 1 }) => getMemes(token, pageParam),
  getNextPageParam: (lastPage) => {
    const totalPages = Math.ceil(lastPage.total / lastPage.pageSize);
    return lastPage.page < totalPages ? lastPage.page + 1 : undefined;
  },
});
```

This allows loading only the current page of memes, significantly improving initial load time.

### 2. Lazy-Load Comments

Only fetch comments when a user explicitly opens a comment section:

```javascript
const { data: comments } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["memeComments", memeId, commentPage],
  queryFn: () => getMemeComments(token, memeId, commentPage),
  enabled: openedCommentSection === memeId,
});
```

### 3. Batch User Data Requests

Consider modifying the API to support batch user data fetching or implementing a caching mechanism to avoid repeated requests for the same user data.


## Conclusion

The current implementation attempts to load all available data upfront, which creates severe performance bottlenecks. By implementing proper pagination, lazy loading, and request optimization, the application can provide a much better user experience with faster initial load times and more efficient resource usage.
